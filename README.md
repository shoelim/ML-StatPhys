# Notes

This repository contains some notes on probability theory and its applications that I wrote whenever I encounter new topics and ideas in my research. Even though these notes may contain some novel and interesting results, they are too unpolished for submission to a first-rate peer reviewed journal (at least for now). However, I am happy to share them with interested reader (please read at your own risk!) and hence the creation of this repository. Any comments and suggestions on these notes are welcome.
