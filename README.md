# Notes

This repository contains some notes on probability theory and its applications that I wrote whenever I encounter new topics and ideas in my research. Any comments and suggestions on these notes are welcome.

These notes will contribute to my long-term writing project (which you can preview here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/jjnntqmcxyhf).
