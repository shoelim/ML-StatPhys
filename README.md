# Notes

This repository contains some notes on probability theory and its applications that I wrote whenever I encounter new topics and ideas in my research. You can find a complete list of these notes on my Google Scholar page (categorized as Technical Report): https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ufTqvyoAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2

Some of these notes are introductory in nature, while others may contain some novel and interesting results. In the latter case, they are too incomplete and/or unpolished for submission to a first-rate peer reviewed journal (at least for now). However, I am happy to share them with interested reader (please read at your own risk!) and hence the creation of this repository. Any comments and suggestions on these notes are welcome.
