# Notes

This repository contains some notes on probability theory and its applications that I wrote whenever I encounter new topics and ideas in my research. Some of these notes are introductory in nature, while others may contain novel and interesting results. In the latter case, they are too incomplete and/or unpolished for submission to a first-rate peer reviewed journal (at least for now). However, I am happy to share them with interested reader (please read at your own risk!) and hence the creation of this repository. Any comments and suggestions on these notes are welcome.
